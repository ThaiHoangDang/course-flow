AI is the sub-area of computer science devoted to creating software and hardware to get computers to do things that would be considered intelligent as if people did them. Artificial intelligence has had an active and exciting history and is now a reasonably mature area of computer science. Many of the research discoveries have now reached the point of industrial application and. many companies have made and saved millions of dollars by exploiting the results of AI research. However the goal of emulating human intelligence has not been reached and many stimulating and challenging problems remain.                ",
