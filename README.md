## II. Description
Nowadays, even though numerous schools around the world have applied online course management systems, the number of universities that use offline and traditional ways is still considerable. Consequently, students in those schools might experience unwanted difficulties during the process of enrolling and managing courses. In addition, some existing online systems show unprofessionalism in design, causing even more problems for students than the traditional way. 

The awareness of the pervasive inefficiencies in educational institutions motivated our team to develop an online enrollment system. Our application, Course Flow, aims to streamline and automate the course registration process, reduce administrative workload, and provide an intuitive experience for all parties engaged in the academic journey.
